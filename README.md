# emochi-bot-2.0
An Emoji bot for discord

### How to set it up
Create an info.txt inside your working directory; in the same directory as your source files

Inside info.txt, have 2 lines: 
token: [bot token]
hook_url: [webhook url going to your desired channel]

### Current progress

This bot now works, but there are still a few optimizations and functionality to add

### API's used
- Discord.py

- Flask

- Requests

## Credits

As of now, I would like to give credit to paul (github at https://github.com/hillcrestpaul0719) for the main brute of the theory behind adding discord emojis into messages. Don't worry tho - I still coded all of the code here, though I did use a few api's

I would also like to thank my fellow classmates for this heck giant emoji_links.txt file, idt I could have as large of a database without them
So without further ado, thank you
