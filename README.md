# emochi-bot-2.0
An Emoji bot for discord

## How to set it up
Create an info.txt inside your working directory; in the same directory as your source files

#### Inside info.txt, you have 1 line: 

token: [bot token]

## Current progress

The bot works mostly, there's a few things I guess I can add and fix, but I'm too lazy to add them B)

## API's used
- Discord.py

- Flask

- Requests

## Credits

I would like to give credit to Paul (github at https://github.com/hillcrestpaul0719) for the main brute of the theory behind adding discord emojis into messages. Don't worry tho - I still coded all of the code here, though I did use a few api's

Furthermore, I copied the pillow workaround to save a transparent gif file properly from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60948028/python-pillow-transparent-gif-isnt-working, which adapted code from https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/4644

I would also like to thank my classmates for a giant database of emotes which I could ~~pirate~~ borrow for this bot. So, without further ado, thank you:
